This is the code for the midi controller I made, as detailed in this blog post:

https://dayvonjersen.com/blog/32-knob-midi-controller

The final version of the code is in:

sketch_jan18c/sketch_jan18c.ino

I wasn't using git at the time and Arduino IDE's default save paths are
terrible apparently. The earliest sketches are from May and June 2012 and the
final, fixed version is from January 2014.
